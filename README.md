# Face-Recognition-Clustering
Group a set of facial images based on their identity using Facial_Recognition library for Python.

All the facial images go into "all_images" folder.

Facial images from "all_images" folder are grouped into a resultant folder.

Ex - All "Obama" images go into "resultant/01" folder
     All "Trump" images go into "resultant/02" folder
